Version 0.5.0
-------------

Released on March 6, 2025.

 -  The `yoyak scrape` and `yoyak summary` commands now accept a local file path
    and `-` as an argument.  If `-` is given, the commands read the input from
    the standard input.

 -  The output of the `yoyak scrape` and `yoyak summary` commands is now
    streamed to the standard output.  This change allows you to process the
    output in real-time.

 -  The `yoyak scrape` and `yoyak summary` commands now accept `SIGINT`
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the process gracefully.  If they are
    interrupted, no more tokens are consumed, and the process is terminated
    after the current token is processed.

 -  Added `-d`/`--debug` option to enable debug logging.

 -  Added more models:

     -  `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest`
     -  `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`
     -  `gemini-2.0-flash`
     -  `gpt-4.5-preview`

 -  Moved the path of the configuration file to:

     -  Linux: *`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/yoyak/config.toml* or
        *`$HOME`/.config/yoyak/config.toml*
     -  macOS: *`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/yoyak/config.toml* or
        *`$HOME`/.config/yoyak/config.toml*
     -  Windows: *`%APPDATA%`\yoyak\config.toml*

 -  The `-l`/`--language` option now skips translation if the source language is
    the same as the target language.


Version 0.3.0
-------------

Released on February 10, 2025.

 -  We now distribute the official executables for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
    You can download them from the [releases page].

 -  Added `-u`/`--user-agent` option to `yoyak scrape` and `yoyak summary`
    commands to specify a custom `User-Agent` string.

 -  Yoyak now can be identified through its unique `User-Agent` string.  The
    `User-Agent` string is `Yoyak/0.3.0` followed by the version of Deno, e.g.,
    `Yoyak/0.3.0 (Deno/2.1.9)`.  [[#1]]
